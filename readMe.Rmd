## Introduction

This web app generates HIV or/and HCV treatment and care cascade analysis from individual-level data.
The user is able to upload individual-level data for their patients in the specified formate below, and three output results will be generated:  

1. Cascade table with the total number of patients in each step of the cascade and their percentage
2. Table summarizing the median and mean of time between different steps on the cascade
3. Cascade results plotted in a bar graph.

For HIV cascade, if the estimated number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) is known, the user will have the option to add it and generate the cascade results as a percentage of PLHIV (in which PLHIV would be 100%) otherwise, the cascade results will be as a percentage of those diagnosed (HIV+).  

For HCV cascade, if the number of Ab tests, results and RNA tests are known, the user will have the option to add them and generate the cascade results as a percentage of Ab tests conduted (in which Ab tests would be 100%) otherwise, the cascade results will be as a percentage of those diagnosed (HCV+, those with positive RNA tests).  

### HIV data  

The key variables that need to be included in the uploaded dataset are:  

1. **"hiv_posresult"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = HIV -ve result, 1 = HIV +ve result  
2. **"linkagetocare_hiv"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = wasn't linked to care, 1 = was linked to care  
3. **"art_ini"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = didn't start ART, 1 = started ART  
4. **"vl_sup"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = didn't achieve viral suppression, 1 = achieved viral suppression  
5. **"retained_care_hiv"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = wasn't retained in care, 1 = was retained in care  
6. **"date_hiv_test"** -> date variable, the date of conducting HIV test (if the person didn't do the test = NA)  
7. **"date_hiv_posresult"** -> date variable, the date of receiving the positive HIV result (if the person didn't do the test or received a negative result = NA)   
8. **"date_linkagetocare_hiv"** -> date variable, the date of getting linked to care (if the person didn't get linked to care or had an NA previously = NA)  
9. **"date_art_ini"** -> date variable, the date of starting ART (if the person didn't start ART or had an NA previously = NA)  
10. **"date_vl_sup"** -> date variable, the date of achieving viral suppression (if the person didn't achieve viral suppression or had an NA previously = NA)  

### HCV data  

The key variables that need to be included in the uploaded dataset are:  

1. **"rna_posresult"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = HCV RNA -ve result, 1 = HCV RNA +ve result  
2. **"linkagetocare_hcv"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = wasn't linked to care, 1 = was linked to care  
3. **"tx_ini_hcv"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = didn't start HCV treatment, 1 = started HCV treatment  
4. **"tx_comp_hcv"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = didn't complete HCV treatment, 1 = completed HCV treatment  
5. **"svr"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = didn't achieve viral suppression, 1 = achieved viral suppression  
6. **"retainedincare_hcv"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = wasn't retained in care, 1 = was retained in care  
7. **"reinfection"** -> dichotomous variable 0 = didn't get re-infected, 1 = got re-infected  
8. **"date_ab_ag_test"** -> date variable, the date of conducting Ab HCV test (if the person didn't do the test = NA)
9. **"date_ab_ag_posresult"** -> date variable, the date of receiving the positive Ab HCV result (if the person didn't do the test or received a negative result = NA)
10. **"date_rna_test"** -> date variable, the date of conducting HCV RNA test (if the person didn't do the test = NA)  
11. **"date_rna_posresult"** -> date variable, the date of receiving the positive HCV RNA result (if the person didn't do the test or received a negative result = NA)  
12. **"date_linkagetocare_hcv"** -> date variable, the date of getting linked to care (if the person didn't get linked to care or had an NA previously = NA)  
13. **"date_tx_ini_hcv"** -> date variable, the date of starting HCV treatment (if the person didn't start treatment or had an NA previously = NA)   
14. **"date_tx_comp_hcv"** -> date variable, the date of completing HCV treatment (if the person didn't complete treatment or had an NA previously = NA)  
15. **"date_svr"** -> date variable, the date of achieving viral suppression (if the person didn't achieve viral suppression or had an NA previously = NA)  
16. **"reinfection_date"** -> date variable, the date of getting re-infection (if the person didn't get re-infected or had an NA previously = NA)
