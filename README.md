# cascadeapp
This is a shiny application that assess HIV and HCV treatment and care cascades. 
It allows users to upload their individual-level data to generate cascade results. 

There are three versions of this app; 
version 1.0 which allows users to upload multiple files which it complies and generates the results for the complied datasets. 
Version 1.1 does the same thing except it generates separate tabs for the individual datasets
Version 2 is different in the sense that the user uploads only one master individual-level dataset for all patients 
  (HIV and HCV),and it generates summary of demographics, and risk factors as well as the cascade results.
  
  
In the folders for version 1.1 and version 2, simulated data can be found to be used to test the app. Data for version 1.1
can be used for version 1.0

This work was done as part of my practicum with Dr. Marina Klein at 
Centre for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center.

Special thanks to Leo Wong for his help with the code and to Placide Nsengiyumva for his discussions which helped in improving the app and the features of the app.
